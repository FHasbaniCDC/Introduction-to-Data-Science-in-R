Course Overview

The Introduction to Data Science using R course is designed as an introduction to elements that constitutes the skill set of a data scientist. This course will emphasize practical techniques for working with large-scale data. Specific topics covered will include statistical modeling and machine learning, data pipelines, R programming language, "big data" tools, and real world topics. Data Scientists possess the ability to look at things differently to find patterns, along with the activities of cleansing, preparing, and aligning the data to extract insights and information from data. Our introductory course leverages the open-source programming language R. R has for a long time been popular for data processing and statistical analysis. Among R's strengths are that it's a succinct programming language and has an extensive repository of third party libraries, Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), for performing all kinds of analyses.
Expected Learning Objectives

The objectives of this course are to:

•	Introduce data science essentials by exploring the data science process
•	Learn some of the specialized R tools and techniques that data scientists use every day like regular expressions, iterators and list comprehensions.
•	Learn how to write high-quality R code for ease and readability
•	Learn the basics of data ingestion and selection
•	Explore R language fundamentals, including basic syntax, variables, and data types and structures.
  o	Functions
  o	Vectors and Matrices
  o	Factors
  o	Data Frames
  o	Lists 
  
•	Understand the importance and process for data cleaning, integration and transformation.
•	Explain the significance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in data science. Apply basic tools (plots, graphs, summary statistics) to carry out EDA.
•	Learn the fundamentals of data exploration and visualization in R, using ggplot2
  o	Understand the process of exploring datasets
  o	Know how to create and interpret basic plot types
•	Introduce a variety of statistical analysis techniques such a distributions, sampling and t-tests.
•	Present basic methods of machine learning that share the same central goal of learning the most valuable and distinctive patterns based on examples provided by a human.
